I'm a Data Scientist at Lazard, where I apply statistical and machine learning to finance at the world's largest independent investment bank. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in statistics and applied math, and I'm currently pursuing a MS in computer science (part-time) from the University of Texas at Austin.

## Projects

**Reinforcement Learning on NHL Expected Goal Models in SuperTuxKart** [[pdf]](../assets/files/supertuxkart_deep_learning.pdf)

Applying key factors and lessons learned from National Hockey League (NHL) expected goal models to SuperTuxKart using reinforcement, imitation, and deep learning approaches via a state-based agent. 

*Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning (pytorch, optuna), Python*

**Predicting Batting Performance with Ensemble Neural Nets and Data Augmentation in Baseball Simulator** [[pdf]](../assets/files/Brokenbat_Player_Modelling.pdf)

Developing a metric to evaluate batting performance, identifying the drivers of increased offensive ability, and using ensemble neural net architecture with data augmentation to improve prediction of batting performance for 20,868 seasons in a baseball simulator.

*Deep Learning (pytorch), Machine Learning (sklearn), Web Scraping (beautifulsoup, selenium, requests), Python, SQL*

**Quantitative Analysis for Baseball Simulator** [[Web Application]](https://share.streamlit.io/hluo27/broken_bat_app/main)

Web application to present deep learning model that predicts batter performance in a baseball simulator.

*Deep Learning (pytorch), Machine Learning, Dashboards (streamlit), Python, SQL*

**Yelp Review Rating Prediction with Stacked LSTMs and Data Augmentation** [[pdf]](../assets/files/yelp.pdf)

Various NLP architectures including stacked LSTMs, ensemble transformers, and logistic regression were applied in conjunction with data augmentation techniques to effectively predict Yelp review ratings.

*Natural Language Processing (NLP) (nltk, transformers), Deep Learning (pytorch), Machine Learning (sklearn, optuna), Python*

**A Statistical Approach to Analyzing and Mitigating Question-Answering Artifacts in SQuAD** [[pdf]](../assets/files/qa_artifacts_nlp.pdf)

A statistical approach was used to analyze the behaviour of pre-trained question-answering models, identifying areas where it demonstrates poor textual and logical understanding. This was improved using an adversarial challenge, showing some improvement in questions that require a higher degree of logical understanding and extrapolation.

*Natural Language Processing (NLP), Statistical Inference, Python*

**Identifying Optimal Draft Strategies in a Baseball Simulator** [[pdf]](../assets/files/BrokenBat_Draft_Report.pdf)

Scraping and analysis of 108,488 draft picks from 23 seasons based on various draft metrics in a baseball simulator.

*Web Scraping (beautifulsoup, selenium, requests), Python, SQL*

**[Asian Americans in Hockey](https://asianamericansinhockey.com/)**

Writing profiles and updates on hockey players of Asian descent. November 2018-Present.
