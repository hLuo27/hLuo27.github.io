I'm a Data Scientist at Lazard interested in statistical and machine learning applications to finance/social sciences. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in statistics and applied math, and I'm currently pursuing a MS in computer science (part-time) from the University of Texas at Austin.

I also write about the stories of players, coaches, and leaders of Asian descent in hockey at [https://asianamericansinhockey.com/](https://asianamericansinhockey.com/)
