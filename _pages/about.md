I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Lazard interested in statistical applications to finance/social sciences and the ethics of artificial intelligence. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in statistics and applied math. I am currently pursuing a part-time MS in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin. 

I also write about the stories of players, coaches, and leaders of Asian descent in hockey at https://www.asianamericansinhockey.com/
