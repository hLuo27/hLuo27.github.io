I'm a Data Scientist at Lazard interested in causal inference, statistics in finance/social sciences, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020 with a BA in statistics and applied math.

I also write about the stories of players, coaches, and leaders of Asian descent in hockey at [Asian Americans in Hockey](https://asianamericansinhockey.com/)
